1) How do I approach designing software?
When it comes to designing software, I like to read over the requirements first to get an idea of what I will be working on. From there I like to try to approach the task piece by piece so I do not have too much on my plate. This is where the actual development comes into play.

2) How do I approach developing programs?
For me it helps to make something small to make sure I am on the right track. From there I like to add onto it with whatever is needed for that project. I think starting off with a base and a good foundation is the best way to develop a program.

3) How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science can help me in reaching my goals because it will help me obtain a good job to help provide for my family. Not only that but I will get to work everyday with something I like a lot which is technology. There are so many different paths that I can take with computer science and I am looking forward to where I will end up.
